## Hi, my name is Christian Nguyen! Welcome to my page. 

I am excited to begin a new journey on Github. After working on an autonomous invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) diagnostic CNN on MatLab, I decided to share some of my efforts on this page. Here you can find my ML learning journey, as well as my many personal projects and interests. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating CNNs for medical imaging diagnostics. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tensorflow and Python.
